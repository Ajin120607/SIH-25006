## Problem Title
SIH 25006: Development of a Digital Farm Management Portal for implementing Biosecurity measures in Pig and Poultry Farms
## Problem Description
### Background

Biosecurity is a cornerstone of animal health management, particularly in the pig and poultry sectors, where disease outbreaks such as Avian Influenza and African Swine Fever can cause significant economic losses, threaten food security, and disrupt rural livelihoods. Despite its importance, many farmers—especially smallholders in resource-limited areas—struggle to access practical, actionable information on biosecurity protocols, risk assessment tools, and regulatory compliance requirements.

### Problem Description

There is an urgent need for a user-friendly, digital platform that empowers farmers to implement, monitor, and sustain robust biosecurity practices on their farms. This portal should offer end-to-end solutions for farm-level biosecurity management by integrating:

• Customizable risk assessment tools based on local epidemiological conditions.
• Interactive training modules and best practice guidelines tailored for pig and poultry production systems.
• Compliance tracking features aligned with regulatory frameworks to help farmers work toward disease-free compartment recognition.
• Real-time alerts and monitoring dashboards for disease outbreaks and biosecurity breaches.
• Multilingual and mobile-first design to ensure accessibility in remote and rural areas.

The platform should also enable data collection and analysis for policy support, foster collaborative networking among stakeholders (farmers, veterinarians, extension workers, etc.), and promote long-term resilience and sustainability in the livestock sector.

### Expected Outcomes

• Enhanced farmer awareness and education on biosecurity.
• Improved risk management at the farm level as well as self-assessment.
• Easy access to customized biosecurity protocols and guidelines.
• Digital record-keeping and compliance tracking.
• Timely alerts and disease notifications to farmers.
• Healthier livestock and increased farm productivity.
• Empowerment of small and marginal farmers with limited resources.
• Support to authorities in data-driven surveillance and policy making.
• Stronger collaboration across the livestock ecosystem.
• Improved national preparedness for zoonotic and transboundary diseases.

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is a Digital Biosecurity Farm Management Portal that integrates risk assessment, training, compliance tracking, and real-time disease monitoring into a single accessible platform. It provides farmers with AI-driven, farm-specific biosecurity recommendations based on local disease risks and farm practices. Interactive multilingual learning modules help farmers easily understand and adopt best practices, while digital logs and automated compliance scoring assist them in meeting regulatory requirements. A centralized dashboard delivers real-time alerts on outbreaks, enabling quick preventive action. The platform also connects farmers with veterinarians and extension workers for timely support. Its mobile-first, offline-enabled design ensures usability for smallholders in remote areas. The solution is unique because it brings end-to-end biosecurity management, smart analytics, and farmer-friendly digital tools into one unified ecosystem.

## Technical Approach
The platform will be developed using React/Flutter for a mobile-first interface, Node.js/Python (Django/FastAPI) for backend services, and PostgreSQL/Firestore for secure farm data storage. AI-based risk scoring will be implemented using Python ML models, while GIS APIs will provide location-based disease alerts. The system architecture follows a modular microservices approach to ensure scalability and easy integration with government databases. Implementation will follow an Agile methodology, starting with requirement analysis, prototype design, module development, testing, and deployment. A workflow involves farmer input → risk assessment engine → recommendations → dashboard visualization → compliance tracking. The prototype will include UI screens, data flow diagrams, and an end-to-end functional demo of core modules.

## Feasibility and Viability
The solution is highly feasible due to the availability of stable digital technologies, increasing smartphone penetration among farmers, and strong government support for livestock digitization. Cloud-based architecture and AI models make the system scalable and suitable for farms of all sizes. Key challenges include low digital literacy, poor rural connectivity, data accuracy issues, and initial resistance from farmers. These risks can be managed through multilingual interfaces, voice-assisted guidance, offline access, and simple workflows. Data validation tools and vet-assisted input will reduce inaccuracies. Awareness campaigns and training sessions will improve adoption, while secure cloud hosting and encryption ensure safe data handling.

## Impact and Benefits
The solution will significantly improve farmers’ awareness, enabling them to adopt stronger biosecurity measures and reduce losses from major livestock diseases. It empowers small and marginal farmers by providing easy access to expert guidance, risk assessment, and compliance tools. Economically, healthier livestock leads to higher productivity, lower mortality, and reduced treatment costs. Socially, it strengthens rural livelihoods and supports safer food production. Environmentally, better waste management and controlled disease spread reduce contamination risks. The platform also supports authorities with real-time data for surveillance and policymaking, creating a more resilient and disease-prepared livestock ecosystem.
